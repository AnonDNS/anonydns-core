🌐 What is AnonyDNS?
AnonyDNS isn’t just a DNS system — we’re building our own internet.

The current internet is controlled by centralized entities: corporations, governments, and global authorities like ICANN. They can block, censor, and monitor. We’re creating a network where none of that is possible — a fully anonymous, censorship-resistant, decentralized internet.

🧱 What We’re Building
Our Own Core Systems No ICANN. No root servers we don’t control. We’re building our own DNS infrastructure from scratch.

Custom Domain Names Domains like .anon, .dulmeth, and others — fully independent and outside the global DNS hierarchy.

Tor + VPN Integration We’re connecting to the global Tor network and secure private networks to ensure maximum anonymity. No one knows who you are or where you’re connecting from.

🔐 Why It Matters
Total Freedom Escape censorship. Access any information, anywhere.

Maximum Privacy No surveillance. No tracking. No metadata leaks.

True Ownership This network doesn’t belong to any company or government. It belongs to us — the people who build and use it.

🚧 What’s Next?
We’re starting by building our own DNS root system and connecting it to Tor and VPN-based routing. Then we’ll launch services like:

Decentralized web hosting

Anonymous email

File sharing

URL shorteners

And more...
