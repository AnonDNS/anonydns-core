# 🌐 AnonyDNS Vision

**AnonyDNS** is not just a DNS system — it's the foundation of a rootless, decentralized internet.

## 🚀 Why We Exist

The current internet is governed by centralized authorities — ICANN, governments, corporations. These entities control access, censor content, and compromise privacy. We believe in a different future:

- No central root zones
- No gatekeepers
- No surveillance

We’re building a network where:

- **No one can block you**
- **No one can trace you**
- **No one owns your identity**

---

## 🧱 What We’re Building

- **Independent DNS Core** — no ICANN, no root zone dependency  
- **Custom TLDs** — `.anon`, `.dulmeth`, and more  
- **Tor + VPN Mesh** — full anonymity and traffic obfuscation  
- **Decentralized Hosting** — unstoppable websites and services  
- **Anonymous Services** — email, file sharing, URL shorteners

## 🛡️ Our Philosophy

This is not a product.  
This is not a company.  
This is a **protocol for freedom**.

We don’t ask for permission.  
We build the infrastructure we want to live in.
